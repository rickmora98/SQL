# sql-challenge 

This repository contains my solutions to Data Analytics Bootcamp Homework Assignment for week #9.

#### Folders/Files:

> **"EmployeeSQL"** (main folder) <br>
> - *"table_setups.sql"* (schemata for creating the tables needed for this assignment) <br>
> - *"employee_queries.sql"* (postgresql queries for data analysis portion of assignment) <br>
> - *"Employee.ipynb"* (jupyter notebook file containing code for bonus questions) <br>
> - *"EmployeesERD.png"* (image of the table relationship diagram) <br>
> 
> **"data"** (subfolder) <br>
>	- *"departments.csv"* (input data file if needed) <br>
> 	- *"dept_emp.csv"* (input data file if needed) <br>
> 	- *"dept_manager.csv"* (input data file if needed) <br>
> 	- *"employees.csv"* (input data file if needed) <br>
> 	- *"salaries.csv"* (input data file if needed) <br>
> 	- *"titles.csv"* (input data file if needed) <br>
	
#### Note: <br>

The csv files in subfolder *"data"* are only needed if re-building the tables from scratch. <br>
The Jupyter notebook requires you to either hardcode your postgresql password into the cell where indicated <br>
or putting your postgresql password into a config.py file before running. <br>
